This theme only contains styling for Ryuzine Writer.  It was also designed to be used as a “base” for other Ryuzine Writer themes that want to use a “tabbed” User Interface.

Either copy the “writer_base.css” file into your custom theme and use:

@import url(“writer_base.css”);

at the head of your custom theme’s “writer.css” stylesheet

- OR -

If you are certain that the “writer” theme will be available you can just import it like this:

@import url(“../writer/writer_base.css”);

Note: The “writer_base.css” only defines the colors specific to the “writer” layout.  If you also want base colors for other UI elements you should do this:

For a light color base:
@import url(“../light/writer.css”);
@import url(“../writer/writer_base.css”);

For a dark color base:
@import url(“../dark/writer.css”);
@import url(“../writer/writer_base.css”);
